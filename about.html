				I'm from Los Angeles, California originally. My friends call me Hollywood in Berlin due to my original geographical status. I love this nickname. I love to paint and play music. I lived in Berlin for 5 years. Between Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, I covered many kilometers of biking in the never ending city. Exploring the West to East and North to South, it always brought something new along the way. Now I am living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is a bit colder here as I was warned. I feel the difference. I am moving from Amager to Østerbro July 1st. I look forward to moving. I think Amager was ok, but I prefer to be a bit more inner city. I biked here as well, pretty much year round.

				I am back into my yoga practice these days. I had a break for awhile in the deep winter. I sure missed it. Yoga helps me both mentally and physically stay in a nice space. Meditation is also another tool I use to keep me grounded and peaceful. I can only suggest these to anyone if they desire a pause button on life. Who wouldn't enjoy that ? I work in acrylic paints and music, while my wife is a photographer. You can see this photo of me below in Amager that she took with my old analog camera. I shoot photos as well, but I am more into mixing the paints these days.

				I vacation as ofter as possible to Rørvig, here in Denmark. My wife has a summer house out there and her parents live there as well. To be near the beach with forests is a magical combination. I look forward to my next voyage. In this photo below, you can see the beauty and serenity with which Rørvig provides.
