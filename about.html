				About Me
			</h2>


			<p>
				I come from Los Angeles, California originally. I admire the visual arts and music very much. I recently acquired a vintage Yamaha FX 500. This is the original sound modification box that the British band, Slowdive, used for their signature sound. The sound is unique and creates a smooth wash effect. I would say it is incredible and luxurious in very much the same way Art Deco has an impact on the senses.

				Another thing about myself that is quite important to me is practicing yoga. I usually get to class 4 days per week. I would like more, but I have been quite busy lately with school and biking in shit weather.

				I play guitar and many other instruments. One of my favorite creative roles is songwriting.
				When I put a great chord progression together with a memorable melody, my day feels complete. I guess that is one of the beauties of the creative, the reward.
