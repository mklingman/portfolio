        <h1>SIALA WEBSHOP</h1>
        <p>This is a freelance project that I made with two co-students. After collaborating with the speaker company Siala for our 2nd semester exam they asked us to create their first webshop for them.

<p class="bold">The case</p>
<p>Siala is a start-up from Copenhagen that makes handmade, customised speakers in natural materials. When we started working with them they were about to launch their first speakers, but they didn’t have a strong online presence yet. We decided to make a digital solution for them to help brand and sell their product - a website, visual identity and online marketing plan.</p>

<div class="column">
    <p class="bold">Branding</p>
    <p>In order to figure out what Siala is all about we did some analysis on the company’s values and business propositions. We interviewed the founders of Siala, analyzed their target group, business model and competitors. This helped us to make a strategy for how to communicate their product to the customers and make them stand out. We decided to focus on keywords such as; customizable,  hand-crafted, locally produced and Danish design. </p>

        <p class="bold">Visual identity</p>
        <p>We choose to work with a minimalistic color palette of different shades of grey as we wished to add a modern and clean feel to the site, that could reflect the product. Inspired by the brass details on the speaker, we’ve implemented som golden details to give the design a lift.   Overall there is three types of photos on the website: product-, lifestyle- and behind-the-scene pictures. This way we can show the details and quality of the product and get the customer invested in the storytelling as well.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p class="bold">Content / SEO</p>
            <p>A big part of the brand storytelling was to select and create the right content. All text is written with careful consideration of both the storytelling and ranking in the search engines. We worked with on-site, off-site and technical SEO. On the main page we created a picture with hover points to engage the visitors and we also created two videos for Siala. We made an interview video with the founder of Siala and a campaign video for social media to bring more potential customers to the website.</p>

                        <p>Besides from making engaging content, we also wanted the website to be as intuitive and simple as possible. In order to do this we worked with traditional web conventions and did a lot of testing throughout the whole process. We did a BERT test the design and a think-out-loud test to see if the user could easily navigate. We also did some expert test to identify technical and design issues.</p>

                            <p>With this project I had the opportunity to build the website with two different approaches. The first version we did for the semester exam was hardcoded with HTML / CSS / JS and Wordpress was used as database to store data. When Siala asked us to build a functional webshop for them, we rethinked the project and decided to work with a template in Wordpress and set up the webshop with WooCommerce. We adjusted the template to look as our original design and added / edited some content.  We chose to work in WP as the owners wished to be able to edit themselves in the future. We also set up their MailChimp.</p>
